## Centralize access using VPC interface endpoints to access AWS services across multiple VPCs

Security and cost are always a top priority for AWS customers when designing their network. Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC),  and itâ€™s related networking components, offer many tools for implementing network connectivity. One such tool is VPC endpoints. Powered by AWS PrivateLink, VPC endpoints are private connections between your VPC and another AWS service without sending traffic over the internet, through a NAT instance, a VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect. In this blog post, I present hub and spoke design where all the spoke VPCs use an interface VPC endpoint provisioned inside the hub (shared services) VPC. This architecture may help reduce the cost and maintenance for multiple interface VPC endpoints across different VPCs.

This code has been created to compliment the blog https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/centralize-access-using-vpc-interface-endpoints/

## Installation

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

This project is set up like a standard Python project.  The initialization
process also creates a virtualenv within this project, stored under the `.venv`
directory.  To create the virtualenv it assumes that there is a `python3`
(or `python` for Windows) executable in your path with access to the `venv`
package. If for any reason the automatic creation of the virtualenv fails,
you can create the virtualenv manually.

To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
```

After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
step to activate your virtualenv.

```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you are a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:

```
% .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.

```
cdk synth
```

To add additional dependencies, for example other CDK libraries, just add
them to your `setup.py` file and rerun the `pip install -r requirements.txt`
command.

### Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

Enjoy!
